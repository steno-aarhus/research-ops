::: callout-warning
This is very much a work-in-progress!
:::

Research Operations (ResearchOps) is about designing and building (or
improving) the social, organizational, and technical infrastructures
that underlie the research lifecycle to be simpler, easier, and faster.
The main aim is to reduce non-creative or non-social work by automating
or streamlining them, as well as to provide training, documentation, and
templates to simplify work that can't be automated or streamlined.

## Our current focuses

-   Collaborate with researchers and staff to identify tasks that are
    repetitive and/or done regularly, and try to convert them to easier
    and faster
-   Work with researchers to help convert intensive, time-consuming
    analyses to be faster
-   Develop and run training sessions or tutorials on different aspects
    within ResearchOps

## Send us ideas for work!

If you have any tasks or activities that you do fairly often, that is
repetitive, that doesn't require much creative work, or is a complex
analytical (not statistical) coding problem, maybe we can work together
to help out! Let us know by filling in the form below and we can set up
a time to chat about it!
